            <h2>1. Crop Rotation</h2>
            <img src="01.jpg" alt="Crop Rotation">
            <p>Crop rotation is an ancient agricultural technique where farmers grow different types of crops in the same field across multiple seasons. This method helps maintain soil fertility, prevents soil depletion, and reduces pest and disease buildup. By rotating crops, farmers avoid exhausting specific nutrients from the soil. For example, legumes like beans and peas fix nitrogen into the soil, while cereal crops like wheat or corn absorb it. This natural cycle reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. Crop rotation also helps control pests and diseases because different plants attract different insects and pathogens. Additionally, rotating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants improves soil structure and prevents erosion. This method is widely practiced across the world and remains an effective strategy for sustainable farming.

            <h2>2. Intercropping</h2>
            <img src="02.jpg" alt="Intercropping">
            <p>Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops together in the same field to maximize productivity and land efficiency. This technique benefits farmers by improving soil health, suppressing weeds, and enhancing crop yields. For instance, planting maize with legumes ensures that nitrogen levels remain balanced in the soil. Additionally, intercropping helps in natural pest control, as some plants act as repellents for pests that would otherwise attack a single-crop field. Farmers often use different intercropping patterns like row intercropping, mixed intercropping, and strip intercropping. This traditional practice has been used for centuries in regions with limited land availability, ensuring both biodiversity and sustainability in agriculture.

            <h2>4. Agroforestry</h2>
            <img src="04.jpg" alt="Companion Planting">
            <p>Agroforestry is a sustainable farming system that integrates trees, shrubs, and crops on the same land. This practice enhances biodiversity, improves soil fertility, and provides shade and wind protection for crops. Trees in agroforestry systems help prevent soil erosion, increase water retention, and even improve carbon sequestration. Additionally, farmers can harvest fruits, nuts, and timber from the trees while continuing to grow their regular crops. Traditional agroforestry techniques have been practiced in Africa, Asia, and Latin America for centuries. This method not only improves crop yield but also enhances environmental sustainability by maintaining ecological balance.

            <h2>5. Green Manuring</h2>
            <img src="05.jpg" alt="Companion Planting">
            <p>Green manuring is a traditional agricultural practice where specific plants, such as legumes, mustard, or clover, are grown and then plowed into the soil to improve fertility. These plants decompose, adding organic matter, nitrogen, and essential nutrients back into the soil. The process enhances soil structure, increases microbial activity, and improves moisture retention, making it highly beneficial for sustainable farming.

                One of the major benefits of green manuring is nitrogen fixation. Leguminous plants, such as beans and clover, have symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which enrich the soil with nitrogen. This reduces the need for chemical fertilizers, making farming more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Additionally, green manuring prevents soil erosion by maintaining ground cover, suppressing weeds, and improving water retention.
                
                Green manure crops can be grown as a main crop, an intercrop, or during fallow periods when the land is not being used. When turned into the soil, they enhance its organic content, leading to better aeration and drainage. This method has been practiced for centuries, especially in Asia and Europe, to maintain soil health. Today, green manuring is widely promoted in organic farming due to its eco-friendly and sustainable nature.</p>

            <h2>6. Terracing</h2>
            <img src="06.jpg" alt="Companion Planting">
            <p>Terracing is an ancient agricultural practice used to cultivate crops on hilly or mountainous terrains. It involves creating flat steps or terraces on slopes to reduce water runoff and soil erosion, allowing farmers to utilize land that would otherwise be unsuitable for farming. This technique has been extensively used in regions such as the Andes, the Himalayas, and Southeast Asia, particularly in rice farming.

                One of the main benefits of terracing is water conservation. Since water runoff is slowed down by the terraces, more water is absorbed into the soil, reducing drought stress on crops. Additionally, terracing prevents soil erosion by stabilizing the land and preventing nutrient loss. This results in higher productivity and long-term soil fertility.
                
                There are different types of terraces, such as bench terraces, contour terraces, and step terraces, each suited to different landscapes. Farmers often reinforce terraces with grass or stone walls to maintain their structure. Although terracing requires significant labor and investment initially, it provides long-term benefits by making sloped lands arable and preventing land degradation. Even today, it remains a crucial practice for sustainable farming in hilly areas, ensuring food security and environmental conservation.</p>        </div>

        <h2>7. Raised Bed Farming</h2>
        <img src="07.jpg" alt="Companion Planting">
        <p>Raised bed farming is an agricultural technique where crops are grown on elevated soil beds instead of directly on the ground. These beds are typically 6 to 12 inches high and can be made using soil, compost, or organic matter. The practice improves soil drainage, prevents waterlogging, and enhances root development, making it particularly useful in areas with heavy rainfall or poor soil conditions.

            One of the major benefits of raised bed farming is better soil aeration. Since the soil in raised beds is loose and well-structured, plant roots can spread more easily, leading to healthier crops. Additionally, raised beds warm up faster in the spring, allowing farmers to start planting earlier in the season. This extends the growing season and increases productivity.
            
            Another advantage is weed control. Since raised beds have a defined boundary, weeds are less likely to spread, and manual weeding becomes easier. Farmers also find that raised beds reduce soil compaction, as they don’t need to walk on the planting area. This technique is widely used in vegetable and flower farming and is ideal for urban gardening. Raised bed farming is a sustainable, low-maintenance method that improves crop yields while conserving soil health. </p></div>

<div class="practice">
    <h2>8. Mixed Farming</h2>
    <img src="08.jpg" alt="Companion Planting">
    <p>Mixed farming is a traditional agricultural system that combines crop cultivation and livestock rearing on the same farm. This integrated approach optimizes resource use, improves soil fertility, and provides farmers with multiple sources of income. The practice has been widely used for centuries, ensuring food security and sustainability.

        One of the key benefits of mixed farming is natural fertilization. Animal manure enriches the soil with essential nutrients, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. In return, crop residues serve as feed for livestock, creating a cycle of resource efficiency. This reduces waste and maximizes farm productivity.
        
        Additionally, mixed farming improves risk management. If one crop fails due to pests, weather conditions, or market fluctuations, farmers can still rely on livestock for income. This diversification enhances economic stability and resilience. Mixed farming also promotes biodiversity, as different plant and animal species coexist, reducing the risk of disease outbreaks.
        
        Farmers practicing mixed farming often rotate crops and integrate agroforestry, further enhancing soil health and environmental balance. This method is especially beneficial for small-scale farmers, as it reduces costs and dependency on external inputs. Mixed farming continues to be a sustainable and profitable agricultural practice worldwide.

    <h2>09. Zero Tillage</h2>
    <img src="09.jpg" alt="Companion Planting">
    <p>Zero tillage, or no-till farming, is an agricultural method where crops are planted directly into unplowed soil without disturbing its structure. Unlike traditional plowing, this practice preserves soil moisture, reduces erosion, and enhances soil health by maintaining its natural composition. It is widely used in sustainable and conservation agriculture.

        One of the biggest benefits of zero tillage is improved soil fertility. When soil is left undisturbed, organic matter decomposes naturally, enriching the soil with nutrients. Additionally, the presence of crop residues on the surface prevents moisture loss and promotes microbial activity, which enhances soil structure and aeration.
        
        Zero tillage also plays a significant role in reducing soil erosion. Since the soil remains covered with crop residues, it is less prone to being washed away by rain or wind. This method conserves water, making it ideal for dry and semi-arid regions. Additionally, it reduces fuel and labor costs, as there is no need for frequent plowing.
        
        Although zero tillage requires specialized equipment for direct seeding, it leads to long-term benefits, including increased crop yields and reduced reliance on chemical inputs. This technique is widely promoted for sustainable agriculture, as it helps preserve soil health while ensuring high productivity.
